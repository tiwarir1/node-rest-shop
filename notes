npm install --save express

app.use -> use as a method sets up a middleware. So, an incoming request has to go through use and whatever we pass to it.
app.use((request, response, next)) - next is also a function here that'll execute the request to move to a next middleware in line. if you don't execute it, the request will not go there.

module.exports = app; - it'll send the return values of app.js to any file that is importing app.js


to test the http requests, install the postman application. getpostman.com
