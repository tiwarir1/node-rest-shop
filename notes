You can check the requests of the apis using an application called Postman.
	getpostman.com

download it for windows and once you install it, skip tp the screen, go to request, close the dialog box.
select the request you wan tto test and on the left bar, enter the url (eg. localhost:3000)

const router = express.Router();
		a part of express. sets up different routes to conveniently handle all the routes and endpoints using HTTP verbs
		now you can use it to set different routes
